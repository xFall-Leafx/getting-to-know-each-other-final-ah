    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> My name is Autumn! I come from a super big family with a lot of cousins. I have three younger sisters, a dog, a cat, and two geckos. I am an Aviation Administration major at Lewis University with a double minor in Aviation Flight and Aircraft Dispatch. I want to be a pilot, but I love meteorology so I want a career with a research agency - hopefully pursuing both passions! </p>
    <h2>What I Hope to Learn in This Course</h2>
    <ul class="b">
        <li>Coding Language - I really enjoyed designing websites and presentations during my time in high school and in my jobs. I hope to better understand user design through the use of coding languages. </li>
        <li>Software Tools - How to utilize the tools available to me. </li>
        <li>Application - Overall, I just want to get a better understating of how to apply what we learn in class to real-world scenarios. </li>
      </ul>
    <h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
    <p>My favorite hobby is a three-way tie between reading, playing video games, and dancing. </p>
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>A fun fact about me is that I like a good adventure! I like to skydive, zip line, travel, and try new foods. </p>
    <h2>Greatest Innovations</h2>
    <p>These innovations are used everyday by people all over the world.</p>
